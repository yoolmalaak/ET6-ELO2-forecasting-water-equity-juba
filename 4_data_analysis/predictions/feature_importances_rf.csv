Most people depend on rivers, streams, or hand-dug wells, which are often not protected from contamination. During the dry season, these water sources sometimes dry up, forcing families especially women and children to walk long distances in search of water.

The water available is usually not treated, and people drink it directly, which causes diseases such as diarrhea, typhoid, and cholera. There are no regular water testing services or treatment facilities in the area.
During the rainy season, flooding and open defecation around water points make the situation worse, as runoff contaminates the water sources. People also lack proper containers for water storage and purification methods like chlorine or filters.

Despite these challenges, the community is very willing to participate in improving water access if given training and tools. With support for borehole repairs, rainwater harvesting, and hygiene education, safe water access in Mewun could greatly improve.
