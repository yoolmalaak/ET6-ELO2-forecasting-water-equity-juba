Most people depend on rivers, streams, or hand-dug wells, which are often not protected from contamination. During the dry season, these water sources sometimes dry up, forcing families especially women and children to walk long distances in search of water.

The water available is usually not treated, and people drink it directly, which causes diseases such as diarrhea, typhoid, and cholera. There are no regular water testing services or treatment facilities in the area.
During the rainy season, flooding and open defecation around water points make the situation worse, as runoff contaminates the water sources. People also lack proper containers for water storage and purification methods like chlorine or filters.

Despite these challenges, the community is very willing to participate in improving water access if given training and tools. With support for borehole repairs, rainwater harvesting, and hygiene education, safe water access in Mewun could greatly improve.

Many households rely on water delivered by trucks or collected from boreholes, which are often far away and sometimes contaminated. During the dry season, water becomes scarce, and prices rise, making it difficult for low-income families to afford. In some areas, water storage tanks are not properly maintained, leading to health risks such as waterborne diseases.","To improve access, the government and NGOs could invest in expanding the piped water network to reach more neighborhoods. Regular water quality testing and public awareness campaigns about water hygiene would also help prevent disease. Installing more community boreholes and providing affordable water purification systems, such as filters or chlorine tablets, could make a big difference. Additionally, better regulation of private water suppliers would ensure the water sold to the public meets safety standards.","In some parts of Juba; particularly sherikat where I reside and some other parts that I have never been, people still depend on the Nile River for daily water use, which exposes them to unsafe water sources. Efforts to improve water infrastructure should also focus on educating the community about safe storage and treatment methods at home. With the right investment and community involvement, it is possible to make safe drinking water accessible and affordable for everyone in Juba.
